# There are three numeric types in Python
# Int
# Float
# Complex

a = 1 # int
b = 3.4 # float
c = 1j

# To verify the type of onbject in python use the type() function

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))


# Print Numbers
# You can also use print() function to display numbers.
# However, numbers are not put inside quotes.

print(3)
print(10)
print(5000)

# You can also do Math inside a print() function.

print(4 + 6)
print(5 * 8)

# You are also able to mix text and number

print("I am", 30, "next year.")

# Integers is a whole number positive or negative number without decimals of unlimited length.

# Float numbers are a positive or negative number with one or more decimals
