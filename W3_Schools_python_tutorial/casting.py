# Python Casting
# Specify a variable type
# There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting.
# Python is an object orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
# Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
# int()
# float()
# str()

# Integer example
a = int(1)
b = int(2.8)
c = int("3")

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# Floats

a = float(1)
b = float(2.8)
c = float("3")
f = float("4.2")

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(f)

a = str(1)
b = str(2.8)
c = str("3")
f = str("4.2")

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(f)
