# Executing Python Syntax
# Python can be executed bu writing directly in the command line or by creating a python file on a server (.py) and running it in the command line.
#e.g. C:\dev\file.py

# Indentation in Python is very important, other programming languages only use it for readibility but in python it serves a purpose.

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two.")

# Python renders the above indentation as a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two.")

# Python will give you an error if you skip indentation like above.

# Semicolons are very rare but optional in Python. You can write multiple statements on one line by seperating them with ;

print("Hello"); print("Bye!")

# However if you put two statements on one line without a seperator (;) Python will give this an error.

print("Hello"); print("Bye!")
